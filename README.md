# Platform Mover

Uses RigidBody MovePosition and MoveRotation to move a rigidbody object. I use this to move platforms and elevators for my
rigidbody character. Elevator mode will move back and forth between the first two points. Use the "active" bool to switch
it on and off. It can rotate to face the next point but always keeps the object level.
